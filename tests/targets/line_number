      ├──49:  CHAPTER XII.   Alice’s Evidence
      ├──58: Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
      ├──61: conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice
      ├──70: There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it
      ├──76: on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
      ├──82: In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
      ├──86: dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
      ├──102: “Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall
      ├──110: be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt
      ├──115: then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no
      ├──130: Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
      ├──136: Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a

      ├──149: it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,
      ├──157: Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
      ├──162: glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s
      ├──170: Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not

      ├──190: It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was
      ├──202: However, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to
      ├──214: “What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a
      ├──222: said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I
      ├──228: into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the
      ├──236: “Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself,
      ├──243: “But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two
      ├──250: Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it
      ├──257: size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice
      ├──277: “Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that
      ├──285: kind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I

      ├──294:      Alice’s love_).
      ├──302: Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
      ├──306: “You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like
      ├──317: Duchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt
      ├──323: Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
      ├──359: “I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes
      ├──367: here till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden
      ├──380: “That _was_ a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
      ├──391: railway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in
      ├──399: “I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying
      ├──410: “Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?
      ├──414: of swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right
      ├──421: “Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s

      ├──434: “Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry
      ├──437: quiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about
      ├──441: pardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all
      ├──450: “I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
      ├──452: answer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near
      ├──458: it kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,
      ├──466: was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low
      ├──472: Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice

      ├──534: “As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to

      ├──574: “Why, _she_, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one
      ├──578: Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
      ├──586: your pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice.
      ├──588: “Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.
      ├──597: Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
      ├──608: “You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why
      ├──612: “Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and
      ├──615: “It _is_ a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder
      ├──628: “You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice severely. “What are
      ├──631: “I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the fifth

      ├──642: “I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice. “But you’re so easily offended,
      ├──647: “Please come back and finish your story!” Alice called after it; and
      ├──657: “I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud,
      ├──663: Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:
      ├──673: bed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left
      ├──679: any more!” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very
      ├──696: ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a
      ├──703: Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and
      ├──706: a fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off
      ├──719: “How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for
      ├──721: began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come
      ├──724: don’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house
      ├──753: Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,
      ├──758: “It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t
      ├──768: “But then,” thought Alice, “shall I _never_ get any older than I am
      ├──772: “Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn
      ├──781: Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was
      ├──787: the door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it,
      ├──788: that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll
      ├──791: “_That_ you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied
      ├──816: There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers
      ├──821: of cucumber-frames there must be!” thought Alice. “I wonder what
      ├──838: “Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to
      ├──856: Alice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m
      ├──862: “We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice
      ├──865: There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I
      ├──868: Alice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”
      ├──870: “A barrowful of _what?_” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,
      ├──876: Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
      ├──887: something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she
      ├──891: “The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she
      ├──904: thing!” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to
      ├──912: and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,
      ├──915: over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was
      ├──923: This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she
      ├──927: “And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant
      ├──935: The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at
      ├──956: The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in
      ├──962: This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,
      ├──970: “I can’t explain _myself_, I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m
      ├──975: “I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied very politely,
      ├──981: “Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you
      ├──988: “Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice; “all I know
      ├──994: Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such _very_
      ├──1000: Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any
      ├──1007: This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.
      ├──1011: “Is that all?” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
      ├──1016: Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,
      ├──1022: “I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t remember things as I
      ├──1028: came different!” Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.
      ├──1032: Alice folded her hands, and began:—
      ├──1077: “Not _quite_ right, I’m afraid,” said Alice, timidly; “some of the
      ├──1087: “Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one
      ├──1092: Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
      ├──1098: mind,” said Alice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.”
      ├──1103: “But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she
      ├──1110: This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a
      ├──1117: “One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_” thought Alice to
      ├──1123: Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,
      ├──1147: “Come, my head’s free at last!” said Alice in a tone of delight, which
      ├──1153: “What _can_ all that green stuff be?” said Alice. “And where _have_ my
      ├──1169: “I’m _not_ a serpent!” said Alice indignantly. “Let me alone!”
      ├──1175: “I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.
      ├──1181: Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in
      ├──1188: “I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to
      ├──1196: “But I’m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice. “I’m a—I’m a—”
      ├──1201: “I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered
      ├──1210: “I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful
      ├──1217: This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a
      ├──1222: “It matters a good deal to _me_,” said Alice hastily; “but I’m not

      ├──1274: Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood
      ├──1279: Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.
      ├──1289: “Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”
      ├──1295: this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he can’t help it,”
      ├──1309: “How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.
      ├──1314: It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. “It’s really
      ├──1322: “But what am _I_ to do?” said Alice.
      ├──1326: “Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s
      ├──1334: “There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to
      ├──1343: “Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was
      ├──1349: She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite
      ├──1358: “I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite
      ├──1363: Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would
      ├──1372: “Oh, _please_ mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down
      ├──1380: “Which would _not_ be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to
      ├──1387: Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take
      ├──1412: that Alice could hardly hear the words:—
      ├──1426: “Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said to Alice,
      ├──1431: Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
      ├──1433: “just like a star-fish,” thought Alice. The poor little thing was
      ├──1442: thought Alice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be
      ├──1445: “Don’t grunt,” said Alice; “that’s not at all a proper way of
      ├──1448: The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face
      ├──1451: its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did
      ├──1457: said Alice, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind
      ├──1461: Alice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do
      ├──1477: The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she
      ├──1483: wider. “Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on.
      ├──1488: “I don’t much care where—” said Alice.
      ├──1492: “—so long as I get _somewhere_,” Alice added as an explanation.
      ├──1497: Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another
      ├──1504: “But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.
      ├──1509: “How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.
      ├──1513: Alice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on “And how
      ├──1518: “I suppose so,” said Alice.
      ├──1524: “_I_ call it purring, not growling,” said Alice.
      ├──1529: “I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’t been invited
      ├──1534: Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer
      ├──1541: “It turned into a pig,” Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back
      ├──1546: Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not
      ├──1556: “I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing
      ├──1563: “Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a
      ├──1586: uncomfortable for the Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only, as it’s asleep,
      ├──1591: Alice coming. “There’s _plenty_ of room!” said Alice indignantly, and
      ├──1596: Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.
      ├──1601: “Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Alice angrily.
      ├──1606: “I didn’t know it was _your_ table,” said Alice; “it’s laid for a great
      ├──1610: Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first
      ├──1613: “You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some
      ├──1619: “Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they’ve
      ├──1625: “Exactly so,” said Alice.
      ├──1629: “I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I
      ├──1644: Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and
      ├──1648: is it?” he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his
      ├──1652: Alice considered a little, and then said “The fourth.”
      ├──1667: Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. “What a
      ├──1674: “Of course not,” Alice replied very readily: “but that’s because it
      ├──1679: Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no
      ├──1689: “Have you guessed the riddle yet?” the Hatter said, turning to Alice
      ├──1692: “No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “what’s the answer?”
      ├──1698: Alice sighed wearily. “I think you might do something better with the
      ├──1705: “I don’t know what you mean,” said Alice.
      ├──1710: “Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but I know I have to beat
      ├──1722: “That would be grand, certainly,” said Alice thoughtfully: “but then—I
      ├──1728: “Is that the way _you_ manage?” Alice asked.
      ├──1741: “I’ve heard something like it,” said Alice.
      ├──1758: “How dreadfully savage!” exclaimed Alice.
      ├──1763: A bright idea came into Alice’s head. “Is that the reason so many
      ├──1769: “Then you keep moving round, I suppose?” said Alice.
      ├──1773: “But what happens when you come to the beginning again?” Alice ventured
      ├──1779: “I’m afraid I don’t know one,” said Alice, rather alarmed at the
      ├──1790: “Yes, please do!” pleaded Alice.
      ├──1799: “What did they live on?” said Alice, who always took a great interest
      ├──1805: “They couldn’t have done that, you know,” Alice gently remarked;
      ├──1810: Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of
      ├──1814: “Take some more tea,” the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.
      ├──1816: “I’ve had nothing yet,” Alice replied in an offended tone, “so I can’t
      ├──1822: “Nobody asked _your_ opinion,” said Alice.
      ├──1826: Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to
      ├──1833: “There’s no such thing!” Alice was beginning very angrily, but the
      ├──1838: “No, please go on!” Alice said very humbly; “I won’t interrupt again. I

      ├──1853: moved into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the
      ├──1855: advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than
      ├──1858: Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very
      ├──1865: “But they were _in_ the well,” Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing
      ├──1870: This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for
      ├──1877: “Why with an M?” said Alice.
      ├──1881: Alice was silent.
      ├──1890: “Really, now you ask me,” said Alice, very much confused, “I don’t
      ├──1895: This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in
      ├──1902: “At any rate I’ll never go _there_ again!” said Alice as she picked her

      ├──1951: things—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching
      ├──1955: “Would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, “why you are

      ├──1975: and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a
      ├──1981: Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face
      ├──1988: When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked
      ├──1993: Alice, she went on, “What’s your name, child?”
      ├──1995: “My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,” said Alice very politely;
      ├──2005: “How should _I_ know?” said Alice, surprised at her own courage. “It’s
      ├──2011: “Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was
      ├──2036: to Alice for protection.
      ├──2038: “You shan’t be beheaded!” said Alice, and she put them into a large
      ├──2050: The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was
      ├──2053: “Yes!” shouted Alice.
      ├──2055: “Come on, then!” roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,
      ├──2061: “Very,” said Alice: “—where’s the Duchess?”
      ├──2068: “What for?” said Alice.
      ├──2072: “No, I didn’t,” said Alice: “I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said
      ├──2075: “She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little

      ├──2088: The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:
      ├──2099: always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice
      ├──2108: Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any
      ├──2124: Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. “It’s no use
      ├──2126: of them.” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put
      ├──2131: “I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a
      ├──2142: “Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s so extremely—” Just then she noticed
      ├──2148: “Who _are_ you talking to?” said the King, going up to Alice, and
      ├──2151: “It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice: “allow me to
      ├──2160: that!” He got behind Alice as he spoke.
      ├──2162: “A cat may look at a king,” said Alice. “I’ve read that in some book,

      ├──2309: “Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last
      ├──2319: “I think I should understand that better,” Alice said very politely,

      ├──2463: “Hold your tongue!” added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.
      ├──2468: “_I’ve_ been to a day-school, too,” said Alice; “you needn’t be so
      ├──2473: “Yes,” said Alice, “we learned French and music.”
