      ├──49:  CHAPTER XII.   [m0s]Alice[m0e]’s Evidence
      ├──58: [m0s]Alice[m0e] was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
      ├──61: conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought [m0s]Alice[m0e]
      ├──70: There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did [m0s]Alice[m0e] think it
      ├──76: on, [m0s]Alice[m0e] started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
      ├──82: In another moment down went [m0s]Alice[m0e] after it, never once considering how
      ├──86: dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that [m0s]Alice[m0e] had not a moment to think
      ├──102: “Well!” thought [m0s]Alice[m0e] to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall
      ├──110: be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, [m0s]Alice[m0e] had learnt
      ├──115: then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” ([m0s]Alice[m0e] had no
      ├──130: Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so [m0s]Alice[m0e] soon began
      ├──136: [m0s]Alice[m0e] began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a

      ├──149: it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went [m0s]Alice[m0e] like the wind,
      ├──157: [m0s]Alice[m0e] had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
      ├──162: glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and [m0s]Alice[m0e]’s

      ├──179: happened lately, that [m0s]Alice[m0e] had begun to think that very few things
      ├──186: before,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e],) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper
      ├──190: It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little [m0s]Alice[m0e] was
      ├──202: However, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so [m0s]Alice[m0e] ventured to
      ├──214: “What a curious feeling!” said [m0s]Alice[m0e]; “I must be shutting up like a

      ├──236: “Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said [m0s]Alice[m0e] to herself,
      ├──243: “But it’s no use now,” thought poor [m0s]Alice[m0e], “to pretend to be two
      ├──250: [m0s]Alice[m0e], “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it

      ├──277: “Curiouser and curiouser!” cried [m0s]Alice[m0e] (she was so much surprised, that
      ├──285: kind to them,” thought [m0s]Alice[m0e], “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I

      ├──294:      [m0s]Alice[m0e]’s love_).
      ├──302: Poor [m0s]Alice[m0e]! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
      ├──306: “You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e], “a great girl like
      ├──317: Duchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” [m0s]Alice[m0e] felt
      ├──323: [m0s]Alice[m0e] took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
      ├──359: “I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor [m0s]Alice[m0e], and her eyes
      ├──367: here till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried [m0s]Alice[m0e], with a sudden
      ├──380: “That _was_ a narrow escape!” said [m0s]Alice[m0e], a good deal frightened at the
      ├──391: railway,” she said to herself. ([m0s]Alice[m0e] had been to the seaside once in
      ├──399: “I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said [m0s]Alice[m0e], as she swam about, trying
      ├──410: “Would it be of any use, now,” thought [m0s]Alice[m0e], “to speak to this mouse?
      ├──414: of swimming about here, O Mouse!” ([m0s]Alice[m0e] thought this must be the right
      ├──421: “Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought [m0s]Alice[m0e]; “I daresay it’s

      ├──434: “Well, perhaps not,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e] in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry
      ├──437: quiet thing,” [m0s]Alice[m0e] went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about
      ├──441: pardon!” cried [m0s]Alice[m0e] again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all
      ├──450: “I won’t indeed!” said [m0s]Alice[m0e], in a great hurry to change the subject of
      ├──452: answer, so [m0s]Alice[m0e] went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near
      ├──458: it kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried [m0s]Alice[m0e] in a sorrowful tone,
      ├──466: was quite pale (with passion, [m0s]Alice[m0e] thought), and it said in a low
      ├──472: Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. [m0s]Alice[m0e]
      ├──488: natural to [m0s]Alice[m0e] to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if
      ├──491: older than you, and must know better;” and this [m0s]Alice[m0e] would not allow
      ├──498: Mouse in the middle. [m0s]Alice[m0e] kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she
      ├──532: turning to [m0s]Alice[m0e] as it spoke.
      ├──534: “As wet as ever,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e] in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to
      ├──549: “What _is_ a Caucus-race?” said [m0s]Alice[m0e]; not that she wanted much to
      ├──574: “Why, _she_, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to [m0s]Alice[m0e] with one
      ├──578: [m0s]Alice[m0e] had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
      ├──586: your pocket?” he went on, turning to [m0s]Alice[m0e].
      ├──588: “Only a thimble,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e] sadly.
      ├──597: [m0s]Alice[m0e] thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
      ├──608: “You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e], “and why
      ├──612: “Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to [m0s]Alice[m0e], and
      ├──615: “It _is_ a long tail, certainly,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e], looking down with wonder
      ├──628: “You are not attending!” said the Mouse to [m0s]Alice[m0e] severely. “What are
      ├──631: “I beg your pardon,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e] very humbly: “you had got to the fifth
      ├──636: “A knot!” said [m0s]Alice[m0e], always ready to make herself useful, and looking
      ├──642: “I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor [m0s]Alice[m0e]. “But you’re so easily offended,
      ├──647: “Please come back and finish your story!” [m0s]Alice[m0e] called after it; and
      ├──657: “I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said [m0s]Alice[m0e] aloud,
      ├──663: [m0s]Alice[m0e] replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:
      ├──673: bed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and [m0s]Alice[m0e] was soon left
      ├──679: any more!” And here poor [m0s]Alice[m0e] began to cry again, for she felt very
      ├──696: ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?” [m0s]Alice[m0e] guessed in a
      ├──703: Very soon the Rabbit noticed [m0s]Alice[m0e], as she went hunting about, and
      ├──706: a fan! Quick, now!” And [m0s]Alice[m0e] was so much frightened that she ran off
      ├──719: “How queer it seems,” [m0s]Alice[m0e] said to herself, “to be going messages for
      ├──721: began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss [m0s]Alice[m0e]! Come
      ├──724: don’t think,” [m0s]Alice[m0e] went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house
      ├──753: Luckily for [m0s]Alice[m0e], the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,
      ├──758: “It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor [m0s]Alice[m0e], “when one wasn’t
      ├──768: “But then,” thought [m0s]Alice[m0e], “shall I _never_ get any older than I am
      ├──772: “Oh, you foolish [m0s]Alice[m0e]!” she answered herself. “How can you learn
      ├──781: Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. [m0s]Alice[m0e] knew it was
      ├──787: the door opened inwards, and [m0s]Alice[m0e]’s elbow was pressed hard against it,
      ├──788: that attempt proved a failure. [m0s]Alice[m0e] heard it say to itself “Then I’ll
      ├──791: “_That_ you won’t!” thought [m0s]Alice[m0e], and, after waiting till she fancied
      ├──816: There was a long silence after this, and [m0s]Alice[m0e] could only hear whispers
      ├──821: of cucumber-frames there must be!” thought [m0s]Alice[m0e]. “I wonder what
      ├──838: “Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said [m0s]Alice[m0e] to
      ├──856: [m0s]Alice[m0e],) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m
      ├──862: “We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and [m0s]Alice[m0e]
      ├──865: There was a dead silence instantly, and [m0s]Alice[m0e] thought to herself, “I
      ├──868: [m0s]Alice[m0e] heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”
      ├──870: “A barrowful of _what?_” thought [m0s]Alice[m0e]; but she had not long to doubt,
      ├──876: [m0s]Alice[m0e] noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
      ├──887: something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at [m0s]Alice[m0e] the moment she
      ├──891: “The first thing I’ve got to do,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e] to herself, as she
      ├──904: thing!” said [m0s]Alice[m0e], in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to
      ├──912: and made believe to worry it; then [m0s]Alice[m0e] dodged behind a great thistle,
      ├──915: over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then [m0s]Alice[m0e], thinking it was
      ├──923: This seemed to [m0s]Alice[m0e] a good opportunity for making her escape; so she
      ├──927: “And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said [m0s]Alice[m0e], as she leant
      ├──935: The great question certainly was, what? [m0s]Alice[m0e] looked all round her at
      ├──956: The Caterpillar and [m0s]Alice[m0e] looked at each other for some time in
      ├──962: This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. [m0s]Alice[m0e] replied,
      ├──970: “I can’t explain _myself_, I’m afraid, sir,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e], “because I’m
      ├──975: “I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” [m0s]Alice[m0e] replied very politely,
      ├──981: “Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e]; “but when you
      ├──988: “Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e]; “all I know
      ├──994: [m0s]Alice[m0e] felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such _very_
      ├──1000: Here was another puzzling question; and as [m0s]Alice[m0e] could not think of any
      ├──1007: This sounded promising, certainly: [m0s]Alice[m0e] turned and came back again.
      ├──1011: “Is that all?” said [m0s]Alice[m0e], swallowing down her anger as well as she
      ├──1016: [m0s]Alice[m0e] thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,
      ├──1022: “I’m afraid I am, sir,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e]; “I can’t remember things as I
      ├──1028: came different!” [m0s]Alice[m0e] replied in a very melancholy voice.
      ├──1032: [m0s]Alice[m0e] folded her hands, and began:—
      ├──1077: “Not _quite_ right, I’m afraid,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e], timidly; “some of the
      ├──1087: “Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” [m0s]Alice[m0e] hastily replied; “only one
      ├──1092: [m0s]Alice[m0e] said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
      ├──1098: mind,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e]: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.”
      ├──1103: “But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor [m0s]Alice[m0e] in a piteous tone. And she
      ├──1110: This time [m0s]Alice[m0e] waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a

      ├──1123: [m0s]Alice[m0e] remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,
      ├──1147: “Come, my head’s free at last!” said [m0s]Alice[m0e] in a tone of delight, which
      ├──1153: “What _can_ all that green stuff be?” said [m0s]Alice[m0e]. “And where _have_ my
      ├──1169: “I’m _not_ a serpent!” said [m0s]Alice[m0e] indignantly. “Let me alone!”
      ├──1175: “I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e].
      ├──1181: [m0s]Alice[m0e] was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in
      ├──1188: “I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e], who was beginning to
      ├──1196: “But I’m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!” said [m0s]Alice[m0e]. “I’m a—I’m a—”
      ├──1201: “I—I’m a little girl,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e], rather doubtfully, as she remembered
      ├──1210: “I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e], who was a very truthful
      ├──1217: This was such a new idea to [m0s]Alice[m0e], that she was quite silent for a
      ├──1222: “It matters a good deal to _me_,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e] hastily; “but I’m not

      ├──1243: “Whoever lives there,” thought [m0s]Alice[m0e], “it’ll never do to come upon them
      ├──1261: frog; and both footmen, [m0s]Alice[m0e] noticed, had powdered hair that curled
      ├──1274: [m0s]Alice[m0e] laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood
      ├──1279: [m0s]Alice[m0e] went timidly up to the door, and knocked.
      ├──1289: “Please, then,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e], “how am I to get in?”
      ├──1295: this [m0s]Alice[m0e] thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he can’t help it,”
      ├──1309: “How am I to get in?” asked [m0s]Alice[m0e] again, in a louder tone.
      ├──1314: It was, no doubt: only [m0s]Alice[m0e] did not like to be told so. “It’s really
      ├──1322: “But what am _I_ to do?” said [m0s]Alice[m0e].
      ├──1326: “Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e] desperately: “he’s
      ├──1334: “There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” [m0s]Alice[m0e] said to
      ├──1343: “Please would you tell me,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e], a little timidly, for she was
      ├──1349: She said the last word with such sudden violence that [m0s]Alice[m0e] quite
      ├──1358: “I don’t know of any that do,” [m0s]Alice[m0e] said very politely, feeling quite
      ├──1363: [m0s]Alice[m0e] did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would
      ├──1372: “Oh, _please_ mind what you’re doing!” cried [m0s]Alice[m0e], jumping up and down
      ├──1380: “Which would _not_ be an advantage,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e], who felt very glad to
      ├──1387: [m0s]Alice[m0e] glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take
      ├──1412: that [m0s]Alice[m0e] could hardly hear the words:—
      ├──1426: “Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said to [m0s]Alice[m0e],
      ├──1431: [m0s]Alice[m0e] caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
      ├──1433: “just like a star-fish,” thought [m0s]Alice[m0e]. The poor little thing was
      ├──1442: thought [m0s]Alice[m0e], “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be
      ├──1445: “Don’t grunt,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e]; “that’s not at all a proper way of
      ├──1448: The baby grunted again, and [m0s]Alice[m0e] looked very anxiously into its face
      ├──1451: its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether [m0s]Alice[m0e] did
      ├──1457: said [m0s]Alice[m0e], seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind
      ├──1461: [m0s]Alice[m0e] was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do
      ├──1477: The Cat only grinned when it saw [m0s]Alice[m0e]. It looked good-natured, she
      ├──1483: wider. “Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought [m0s]Alice[m0e], and she went on.
      ├──1488: “I don’t much care where—” said [m0s]Alice[m0e].
      ├──1492: “—so long as I get _somewhere_,” [m0s]Alice[m0e] added as an explanation.
      ├──1497: [m0s]Alice[m0e] felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another
      ├──1504: “But I don’t want to go among mad people,” [m0s]Alice[m0e] remarked.
      ├──1509: “How do you know I’m mad?” said [m0s]Alice[m0e].
      ├──1513: [m0s]Alice[m0e] didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on “And how
      ├──1518: “I suppose so,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e].
      ├──1524: “_I_ call it purring, not growling,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e].
      ├──1529: “I should like it very much,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e], “but I haven’t been invited
      ├──1534: [m0s]Alice[m0e] was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer
      ├──1541: “It turned into a pig,” [m0s]Alice[m0e] quietly said, just as if it had come back
      ├──1546: [m0s]Alice[m0e] waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not
      ├──1556: “I said pig,” replied [m0s]Alice[m0e]; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing
      ├──1563: “Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought [m0s]Alice[m0e]; “but a

      ├──1591: [m0s]Alice[m0e] coming. “There’s _plenty_ of room!” said [m0s]Alice[m0e] indignantly, and
      ├──1596: [m0s]Alice[m0e] looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.
      ├──1601: “Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e] angrily.
      ├──1606: “I didn’t know it was _your_ table,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e]; “it’s laid for a great

      ├──1613: “You should learn not to make personal remarks,” [m0s]Alice[m0e] said with some
      ├──1619: “Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought [m0s]Alice[m0e]. “I’m glad they’ve
      ├──1625: “Exactly so,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e].
      ├──1629: “I do,” [m0s]Alice[m0e] hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I
      ├──1644: [m0s]Alice[m0e] thought over all she could remember about ravens and
      ├──1648: is it?” he said, turning to [m0s]Alice[m0e]: he had taken his watch out of his
      ├──1652: [m0s]Alice[m0e] considered a little, and then said “The fourth.”

      ├──2606: “It must be a very pretty dance,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e] timidly.
      ├──2610: “Very much indeed,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e].
      ├──2617: So they began solemnly dancing round and round [m0s]Alice[m0e], every now and

      ├──3157: “Nothing whatever,” said [m0s]Alice[m0e].
