├──933: question is, what?”
├──935: The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at
├──936: the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that
├──940: behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
├──945: caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly
├──967: “What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly. “Explain
├──983: after that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little

├──1025: “Can’t remember _what_ things?” said the Caterpillar.
├──1041: But, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,
├──1047:     Pray, what is the reason of that?”
├──1065:     That your eye was as steady as ever;
├──1067:     What made you so awfully clever?”
├──1069: “I have answered three questions, and that is enough,”
├──1075: “That is not said right,” said the Caterpillar.
├──1085: “What size do you want to be?” it asked.

├──1117: “One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_” thought Alice to
├──1134: that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she
├──1136: so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her

├──1175: “I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.

├──1207: no use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never

├──1217: This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a

├──1255: For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what
├──1261: frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled
├──1262: all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all
├──1274: Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood
├──1281: “There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for

├──1334: “There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to

├──1345: your cat grins like that?”
├──1347: “It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why. Pig!”

├──1350: jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the
├──1353: “I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t

├──1370: that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.
├──1372: “Oh, _please_ mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down
├──1382: think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the
├──1393: figures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a

├──1465: a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it
├──1479: felt that it ought to be treated with respect.

├──1494: “Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long

├──1498: question. “What sort of people live about here?”

├──1514: do you know that you’re mad?”
├──1516: “To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’s not mad. You grant that?”
├──1526: “Call it what you like,” said the Cat. “Do you play croquet with the

├──1622: “Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?” said
├──1627: “Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.
├──1629: “I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I
├──1630: say—that’s the same thing, you know.”
├──1633: say that ‘I see what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’!”
├──1635: “You might just as well say,” added the March Hare, “that ‘I like what
├──1636: I get’ is the same thing as ‘I get what I like’!”

├──1736: How I wonder what you’re at!’

├──2056: wondering very much what would happen next.
├──2068: “What for?” said Alice.
├──2070: “Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked.
├──2073: ‘What for?’”
├──2093: up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help

├──2110: “and then,” thought she, “what would become of me? They’re dreadfully

├──2143: that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,
├──2144: “—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.”
├──2160: that!” He got behind Alice as he spoke.
├──2162: “A cat may look at a king,” said Alice. “I’ve read that in some book,
├──2179: of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew

├──2254: about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t
├──2255: tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
├──2273: “’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love,
├──2274: ’tis love, that makes the world go round!’”
├──2276: “Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding
├──2281: _that_ is—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of
├──2288: the Duchess said after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful about
├──2295: the moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’”
├──2299: “Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of

├──2332: birthday presents like that!” But she did not venture to say it out
